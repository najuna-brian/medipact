# MediPact - Project Description
## For Hackathon Submission (100 words max)

**MediPact** is a verifiable medical data marketplace built on Hedera Hashgraph that solves the $30B patient data black market problem. Using Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), we create immutable proof of consent and data authenticity, enabling ethical, transparent medical data transactions.

Our MVP demonstrates the "In-Person Bridge" - a hospital adapter that anonymizes patient data, submits cryptographic proof hashes to HCS, and enables verifiable data sharing. Patients receive 60% of revenue via HBAR micropayments, hospitals get 25%, and the platform takes 15%.

**Key Features**: FHIR R4 compliant data processing, automatic PII removal with anonymous ID generation, immutable consent and data proofs on Hedera HCS, automated revenue distribution via smart contracts, and full audit trail on HashScan.

**Tech Stack**: Hedera HCS, Hedera EVM, Hedera Account IDs, Solidity, Node.js, Express.js, Next.js 15, TypeScript, FHIR R4, SQLite/PostgreSQL
