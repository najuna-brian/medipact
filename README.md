# MediPact - The Verifiable Health Pact. Built on Hedera.

> **Hedera Hello Future: Ascension Hackathon 2025**  
> **Theme**: Open Track - Verifiable Healthcare Systems  
> **Tagline**: "The Verifiable Health Pact. Built on Hedera."

## Project Description

MediPact is a verifiable medical data marketplace that empowers patients to control and monetize their anonymized medical data for research. We solve the patient data black market by creating a transparent, ethical platform using Hedera's Consensus Service for immutable proof and HBAR for instant micropayments.

**Problem**: Patients are exploited by data brokers who sell their medical data without consent or compensation. Researchers lack trusted, verifiable data sources. Hospitals have no safe way to share data for research.

**Solution**: A unified platform with two patient onboarding paths—digital and in-person—that uses HCS to create immutable proof of consent and data authenticity, ensuring ethical, verifiable medical data transactions.

## The Problem We Solve

### Patients are Exploited
Medical data is a multi-billion dollar asset. Data brokers buy and sell patient information without knowledge, consent, or compensation. Patients are the product, not the partner.

### Researchers are Blind
Pharmaceutical companies and AI labs need high-quality, diverse data to cure diseases. They're forced to buy from untrusted brokers with no way to verify if data is real, ethically sourced, or unaltered.

### Hospitals are Trapped
Hospitals (especially government hospitals in developing countries) sit on valuable data but have no safe, legal, or easy way to share it for research.

## Our Solution: A Unified, Two-Path Platform

### Path 1: The "Digital Patient" (Future Vision)
For tech-savvy users in urban areas and developed countries:

- **Health Wallet**: Secure place to connect hospital portals, upload lab results, view complete medical history
- **Passive Marketplace**: Simple on/off toggle to sell anonymized data, earn passive income with earnings dashboard
- **Active Studies Portal**: High-value portal where pharma companies post specific studies; patients browse and apply

### Path 2: The "In-Person Bridge" (MVP Focus - Our Secret Weapon)
For billions of patients without smartphones or high digital literacy:

- **Consent**: Hospital clerk explains program, patient signs paper form or uses thumbprint
- **Onboarding**: Clerk scans QR code, links anonymous ID to Mobile Money number
- **Result**: Patient enrolled in Passive Marketplace without ever needing a phone or app

## Technical Architecture

### The MediPact Adapter (Core Engine)
- **Installation**: Small, secure software installed on hospital servers
- **Connection**: Connects to existing EHR via FHIR API (simulated with CSV for MVP)
- **Anonymization**: Automatically strips PII (name, ID, address), replaces with anonymous PID
- **Logging**: Prepares clean, anonymous files for marketplace

### Hedera Integration

**Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)**: Immutable "bulletin board" storing:
- **Consent Proof**: Hash of signed/thumbprint consent form (legal audit trail)
- **Data Proof**: Hash of anonymous lab file (verifies data authenticity)

**HBAR Payments**: Global 60/25/15 revenue split (Patient/Hospital/MediPact)
- Instant micropayments
- Auto-convert to local currency (UGX, etc.)
- Mobile Money integration with SMS notifications

## MVP Demo Flow

Our hackathon MVP demonstrates the core "In-Person Bridge" flow:

1. **Simulated Hospital EHR**: CSV file (`raw_data.csv`) with fake lab results containing patient names and IDs
2. **MediPact Adapter Script**: Reads CSV, anonymizes data (removes PII), generates hashes
3. **HCS Submission**: Posts consent proof hash and data proof hash to Hedera Consensus Service
4. **HCS Proof on HashScan**: Shows transaction on Hedera Testnet explorer (HashScan) - verifiable proof
5. **Payout Simulation**: Displays "PAYOUT SIMULATED: 2,800 UGX sent to patient 077...XXX"

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Hedera Hashgraph
  - Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) via `@hashgraph/sdk`
  - Hedera Agent Kit JS for HCS topic management and message submission
  - HBAR for micropayments
  - Smart Contracts (Solidity) for revenue distribution
- **Backend**: Node.js / TypeScript
- **Frontend**: (Optional for demo) React/Next.js
- **Integration**: FHIR API (simulated), Mobile Money APIs (simulated)
